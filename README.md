# takeMeOutToDinner

I used Bootstrap, Node.js, Mongoose, Express and EJS.

I started off with the routes/CRUD then moved on to the search bar, and google maps.

I wasn't able to get the authentication working or adding extra people to a restaurants list.
I need to figure out how to set up the schema for having additional people.
Also need to figure out how to get google maps to give recommendations base on the users location.
Also need to fix the rating input.
